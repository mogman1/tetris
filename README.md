Yet Another Tetris Clone

###Game Mechanics
* A random tetromino is spawned horizontally in the middle topmost two rows of the tetrion with the straight tetromino always spawning in the second row.
* The tetromino then begins to fall at an interval determined by the current level's difficulty.
* Pressing the right arrow key will rotate the tetromino clockwise and the left arrow key counterclockwise.
* Pressing the down arrow will increase the rate in which the tetromino falls.
* Pressing the spacebar will cause the tetromino to enter a free fall and cannot be aborted.
* The tetromino continues to drop until it either collides with another tetromino or has reached the bottom of the tetrion.
* When the current tetromion in play comes to rest it is possible to score points and remove blocks from the tetrion if there are no gaps within a row of the tetrion.
* You will receive 10 points per row cleared from the tetrion.
* Clearing multiple rows at the same time adds a bonus of 10 additional points per row cleared.
